-- such as the ProcessID for SQL Server and your collation
-- Note: Some columns will be NULL on older SQL Server builds

-- Get instance-level configuration values for instance  (Query 2) (Configuration Values)
SELECT name, value, value_in_use, minimum, maximum, [description], is_dynamic, is_advanced
FROM sys.configurations WITH (NOLOCK)
ORDER BY name OPTION (RECOMPILE);
------

-- Focus on these settings:
-- automatic soft-NUMA disabled (should be 0 in most cases)
-- backup checksum default (should be 1)
-- backup compression default (should be 1 in most cases)
-- clr enabled (only enable if it is needed)
-- clr strict security is new in SQL Server 2017, and is enabled by default
-- cost threshold for parallelism (depends on your workload)
-- lightweight pooling (should be zero)
-- max degree of parallelism (depends on your workload and hardware)
-- max server memory (MB) (set to an appropriate value, not the default)
-- optimize for ad hoc workloads (should be 1)
-- priority boost (should be zero)
-- remote admin connections (should be 1)

-- sys.configurations (Transact-SQL)
-- https://bit.ly/2HsyDZI


-- Returns a list of all global trace flags that are enabled (Query 3) (Global Trace Flags)
DBCC TRACESTATUS (-1);
------

-- If no global trace flags are enabled, no results will be returned.
-- It is very useful to know what global trace flags are currently enabled as part of the diagnostic process.

-- Common trace flags that should be enabled in most cases
-- TF 3226 - Supresses logging of successful database backup messages to the SQL Server Error Log
--           https://bit.ly/2p6MTjS  

-- TF 6534 - Enables use of native code to improve performance with spatial data
--           https://bit.ly/2HrQUpU         

-- The behavior of TF 1117, 1118 are enabled for tempdb in SQL Server 2016 by default
-- SQL 2016 – It Just Runs Faster: -T1117 and -T1118 changes for TEMPDB and user databases
-- https://bit.ly/2lbNWxK           

-- The behavior of TF 2371 is enabled by default in SQL Server 2016 and newer (in compat level 130 and higher)

-- Get SQL Server Agent jobs and Category information (Query 4) (SQL Server Agent Jobs)
SELECT sj.name AS [Job Name], sj.[description] AS [Job Description], SUSER_SNAME(sj.owner_sid) AS [Job Owner],
sj.date_created AS [Date Created], sj.[enabled] AS [Job Enabled], 
sj.notify_email_operator_id, sj.notify_level_email, sc.name AS [CategoryName],
s.[enabled] AS [Sched Enabled], js.next_run_date, js.next_run_time
FROM msdb.dbo.sysjobs AS sj WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN msdb.dbo.syscategories AS sc WITH (NOLOCK)
ON sj.category_id = sc.category_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules AS js WITH (NOLOCK)
ON sj.job_id = js.job_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN msdb.dbo.sysschedules AS s WITH (NOLOCK)
ON js.schedule_id = s.schedule_id
ORDER BY sj.name OPTION (RECOMPILE);
------

-- Gives you some basic information about your SQL Server Agent jobs, who owns them and how they are configured
-- Look for Agent jobs that are not owned by sa
-- Look for jobs that have a notify_email_operator_id set to 0 (meaning no operator)
-- Look for jobs that have a notify_level_email set to 0 (meaning no e-mail is ever sent)

-- Get SQL Server Agent Alert Information (Query 5) (SQL Server Agent Alerts)
SELECT name, event_source, message_id, severity, [enabled], has_notification, 
       delay_between_responses, occurrence_count, last_occurrence_date, last_occurrence_time
FROM msdb.dbo.sysalerts WITH (NOLOCK)
ORDER BY name OPTION (RECOMPILE);
------

-- Gives you some basic information about your SQL Server Agent Alerts 
-- (which are different from SQL Server Agent jobs)
-- Read more about Agent Alerts here: https://bit.ly/2Giz0Xf 










-- Get information on location, time and size of any memory dumps from SQL Server  (Query 6) (Memory Dump Info)
SELECT [filename], creation_time, size_in_bytes/1048576.0 AS [Size (MB)]
FROM sys.dm_server_memory_dumps WITH (NOLOCK) 
ORDER BY creation_time DESC OPTION (RECOMPILE);
------

-- This will not return any rows if you have 
-- not had any memory dumps (which is a good thing)

-- sys.dm_server_memory_dumps (Transact-SQL)

-- Look at Suspect Pages table (Query 7) (Suspect Pages)
SELECT DB_NAME(database_id) AS [Database Name], [file_id], page_id, 
       event_type, error_count, last_update_date 
FROM msdb.dbo.suspect_pages WITH (NOLOCK)
ORDER BY database_id OPTION (RECOMPILE);
------

-- event_type value descriptions
-- 1 = 823 error caused by an operating system CRC error
--     or 824 error other than a bad checksum or a torn page (for example, a bad page ID)
-- 2 = Bad checksum
-- 3 = Torn page
-- 4 = Restored (The page was restored after it was marked bad)
-- 5 = Repaired (DBCC repaired the page)
-- 7 = Deallocated by DBCC

-- Ideally, this query returns no results. The table is limited to 1000 rows.
-- If you do get results here, you should do further investigation to determine the root cause

-- Get number of data files in tempdb database (Query 8) (TempDB Data Files)
EXEC sys.xp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'The tempdb database has';
------

-- Get the number of data files in the tempdb database
-- 4-8 data files that are all the same size is a good starting point, depending on your hardware
-- This query will return no results if your error log has been recycled since the instance was last started
