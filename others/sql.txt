 what is lazy writer? 
Answer
# 1 The job of the lazy writer is to find dirty pages in the buffer pool and write them out to disk and drop those pages from cache. It does this to keep a certain amount of free pages available within the buffer pool for data that may be requested by other queries. The pages that it writes out are ‘older’ pages, ones that haven’t been used for a while.
If there’s lots of available buffers, the lazy writer will be doing relatively little work and the number of pages written to disk will be quite low. If the lazy writer’s consistently writing lots of data, it may indicate that there’s a memory bottleneck.
   


Re: What is Index Segmentation ? 
Answer
# 1 A segment is a part of relational data base and consists of
one or more extents. Each extent is further divided into
blocks. Every segment has an index for holding all of its
data for quick data retrieval. Index segments can be created
explicitly by using the CREATE INDEX command. Storage
parameters for the extents of the index segment can be
specified along with this command

take data from any where.
