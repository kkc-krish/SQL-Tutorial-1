 Get that fresh look: Mix 1 egg white, ¼ cup of whole milk, 2 tbsp of baking soda and ½ a cup of water in a small bowl and blend well. Refrigerate it for a short while and then take a small amount onto a wet washcloth; gently massage it on your skin. After 10 minutes rinse well with warm water and pat dry your skin. 

Jojoba oil moisturiser: Jojoba oil has some very distinguishing properties which will result in a beautiful glowing skin. Natural oils like Jojoba often contain anti-ageing nutrients that help repair damaged skin and prevent further damage. Apply the oil as a moisturiser with deep circular motions and let your skin absorb the smoothness of it. 


Almond facial mask: Soak almonds overnight and take their skin off the next morning and grind them into a paste; while making the paste add rose water to it. Apply onto the skin and let it dry for 20 minutes. Gently wipe off the mask with a damp wash cloth or rinse with lukewarm water.
